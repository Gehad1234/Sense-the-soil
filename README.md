# Sense-the-soil
## one of semicolon startup Front end projects (My startup)
1. **Header Section**:
   - The header contains a logo with the text "Sense the Soil" and a navigation menu with links to different sections (Home, About, Data, Contact).
   - There's also an icon for enabling dark mode (presumably for changing the website's theme).

2. **Home Section**:
   - This section includes a social media icon (GitHub), an image of soil, and introductory text.
   - The introductory text greets the user, introduces the project as "Sense the Soil," mentions it's a project related to the scale of climate change, and provides a "Contact Us" button.

3. **About Section**:
   - The about section has a heading ("About") and an introductory text that explains the project's goals and what it measures.
   - An image related to the project is displayed, and contact information (phone and email) is provided.
   - There's also a "Download Portfolio" button that links to a Google Drive folder.

4. **Data Section**:
   - This section displays data using iframes. It appears to show various charts related to soil moisture and other environmental parameters.
   - There are multiple iframes embedded within this section, presumably showing different types of data.

5. **Contact Section**:
   - This section includes a heading ("Contact") and a form for users to input their name, email, and a message.
   - However, there is a minor issue with the "textarea" element; it has a typo. It should be `<textarea>` instead of `<textare>`.
   - Below the form, there's a "Send" button.

6. **Footer Section**:
   - The footer section currently seems to be empty. It's common to include additional information or links in the footer, such as copyright information, additional navigation links, or social media links.

7. **JavaScript**:
   - The website includes a reference to an external JavaScript file named "script.js." This file is likely used to add interactivity and functionality to the website.
